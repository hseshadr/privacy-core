## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-29

Initial graduation from the proven spike: deterministic detection spine +
reversible in-memory vault + type-enforced Egress Guard + redact→rehydrate loop
+ demo.

### Added

- **Deterministic detection spine** (`detect`) — ported Presidio-style regex +
  checksum recognizers (Luhn, IBAN mod-97, SSN, email, phone, amounts, dates)
  plus finance/name dictionaries.
- **Reversible in-memory vault** (`Vault`) — stable typed placeholders
  (`[CARD_1]`, `[NAME_2]`), same value → same token.
- **Type-enforced Egress Guard** — branded `RedactedPayload`, the `LlmProvider`
  interface that accepts only that brand, and the audited `unsafeBypass` escape
  hatch. Handing raw text to a provider is a compile error.
- **Reversible loop** — `redactForEgress` (the only legitimate payload
  constructor) and `rehydrate` (local restore).
- **Providers** — `NoLLMProvider` (offline echo, runs cold), `OpenRouterProvider`
  (OpenAI-compatible), and `makeProvider` factory.
- **Runnable demo** (`examples/demo`) consuming only the public API, with the
  redact → preview → send → rehydrate wow loop and a `docs/wow.png` proof.
- **Tests** — Vitest unit suite + a Playwright headless-chromium e2e that asserts
  only placeholders cross the wire.
