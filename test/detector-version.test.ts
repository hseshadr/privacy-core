 *
 * A rule's scan mode and the NAME of its shorter-candidate function are
 * included when present. It deliberately does not hash the checksum function bodies — their source
 * text is formatter-sensitive — so a change *inside* `luhnValid`/`ibanValid`/
 * `ssnValid` must be caught by review, not by this guard. Adding, removing,
 * reordering, or re-gating a rule, editing a pattern, or editing a dictionary

 *   `(415) 555-0132`-only phone). Computed from `src/detect/patterns.ts` at the
 *   v0.2.2 tag with this same function.
 * - "2": 0.3.0 — Unicode email; SSN written with any one consistent separator
 *   (dash, dot, whitespace, Unicode dash) ungated, plus an unseparated 9-digit
 *   SSN gated on `ssnValid`; NANP phone (unrestricted parenthesized branch,
 *   `2-9`-gated bare branch, both ending at `(?!\d)`); CARD as a print-layout
 *   grammar scanned at every start with word-closing retries, beside the
 *   v0.2.2 loose rule; IBAN scanned at every start with mod-97-valid,
 *   word-closing retries (registry length, or 15+ for an unregistered country); ROUTING/ACCOUNT with a named `value` group (ACCOUNT 6-17
 *   digits), ordered before SSN. (Recomputed four times before 0.3.0 shipped, after
 *   the pre-release security reviews — "2" was never sealed into a published
 *   receipt with any other ruleset.)
